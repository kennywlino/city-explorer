# City Explorer

**Author**: Kenny W. Lino

**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview

City Explorer is a React application that uses the Axios HTTP client and the LocationIQ API to allow users to make location-based requests and display them.

## Getting Started

In order to get started, you can visit the deployed version at: [city-explorer-kwl-cf.netlify.app](https://city-explorer-kwl-cf.netlify.app)

You also can deploy it locally by downloading this repo and using `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to run the React application.

## Architecture

This project utilizes JavaScript and React framework to maintain the front-end. The Axios library is used to handle the HTTP requests and the LocationIQ API is used for data.

## Change log
